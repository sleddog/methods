#Method: FizzBuzzBazz, Author: John Watts

##This is a file with explanation of how to run my fizzbuzz code.

> My FizzBuzzBazz solution was created in NetBeans, and I would recommend using the same.
> First create a new project in NetBeans named Fizzbuzz, then copy my source file
> "FizzBuzz.java", and replace the source file in the project you created with my
> "FizzBuzz.java" code. From file in NetBeans open the Fizzbuzz project if not
> already opened, select the source code with the mouse, then click the green
> run project key on the tool bar. The function should then run at the bottom of the screen.
> My assertion was placed on line 33 and checks to make sure current iteration is divisible by
> 105 to induce that it is divisible by 3 and 5 and 7 before printing FizzBuzzBazz.
