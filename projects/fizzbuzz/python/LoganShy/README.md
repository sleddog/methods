Thank you for selecting my fine program, and I'm hopeful that you'll find things satisfactory 
concerning the operation of this software. Below are some instructions that you may/may not find useful.

2. If possible, when prompted to, add python to your local PATH.
3. Save the fizzbuzz.py program located in this directory somewhere on your local machine.
4. Try to double click the fizzbuzz py file, it should open and run. If not, proceed to step 5.
