This is a file with explanation of how to run my fizzbuzz code.

My Fizzbuzz solution was created in NetBeans, and I would recommend using the same.

First create a new project in NetBeans named Fizzbuzz, then copy my source file "FizzBuzz.java", and replace the source file in the project you created with my "FizzBuzz.java" code. From file in NetBeans open the Fizzbuzz project if not already opened, select the source code with the mouse, then click the green run project key on the tool bar.
The function should then run at the bottom of the screen.
