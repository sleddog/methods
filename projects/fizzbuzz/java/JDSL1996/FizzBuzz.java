                    ideally this should be closed at the end but that also closes system.in for the program
                    possible fixes (as found online) are:
                        create a wrapper for system.in that gets closed instead
                        close at the end of the program 
                            (which would be the end of main but the scanner is in this class in a loop so id need to move the scanner decloration taking more memory)
                        force the program to ignore the warnings
                        or just ignore it since its a small program for school where the resource potentially leaked is an integer that doesnt mean anything (i chose this one)
